# Timed Peace

This mod will disable peaceful mode after a given timeout.

# You still have to enable peaceful mode in map generation settings

## Use case

When playing with batshit crazy enemy settings, the later stages of the game
can be fun, defending the neverending onslaught of strong enemies against your
walls, but it can be hard to get a foothold in a new game, especially when
combined with high technology multipliers and/or biter mods.

Two major solutions to this are starting with some defense equipment, or
starting in peaceful mode until you have some minimal defenses up.

Starting out with peace enabled, you will probably want to disabled it later.
However, running raw Lua in the console will disable achievements, and it can
be hard to keep yourself honest.

This mod will automatically disable peace after a configurable timeout in
minutes, defaulting to 3 hours.
